# TAPtheme

**A Reactive Bootstrap Theme Editor for Meteor**

TAPtheme reactively compiles [Bootstrap 3](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) with user-defined custom variables and delivers the CSS to clients, who will have their stylesheets updated without refreshing their browser.

An editor template is provided to allow easy editing of all of Bootstrap 3's LESS variables.

TAPtheme comes bundled with several [Bootswatch](https://github.com/thomaspark/bootswatch/) themes.

## Quickstart

Install using meteorite

` $ mrt add tap-theme `

Include the editor template somewhere in your project

` {{> TAPtheme}} `

If you already have bootstrap-3 in your package, remove it.

` $ mrt remove bootstrap-3 `
