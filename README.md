# tap-theme

**A Reactive Bootstrap Theme Editor for Meteor**

TAPtheme reactively compiles Bootstrap 3 with user-defined custom variables and delivers them to clients. All clients will have their CSS updated reactively without refreshing their browser.

An editor template is provided to allow easy editing of all of Bootstrap 3's LESS variables.

TAPtheme comes bundled with several Bootswatch themes.

## Quickstart

Install using meteorite

` $ mrt add tap-theme `

Add the editor template the admin section of your app

` {{> TAPtheme}} `

If you already have bootstrap-3 in your package, remove it.

` $ mrt remove bootstrap-3 `
